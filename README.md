# Market-Analysis
One of my earliest Python projects, this is a simple visualization of the stock performance for Ford, Tesla, and GM, as well as their volume over time. The data is stored in a CSV file for their respective stock. The dates for the CSV are from January 1st, 2017 to January 1st, 2022. It also prints out the perfomance from the latest close.
